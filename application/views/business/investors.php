        Pushpam Group, under Pushpam Foundation has consistently sought to give back to the society to the best of its ability. Till date, it has adopted several rural schools and has made a difference in the lives of thousands of children. Each member of the organization holds a deep passion for philantrophy and we have taken our biggest step yet, in the process, by working towards the development of a hospital & medical college which we will bring healthcare delivery to the large population that desperately needs it as well as quality education in the field of medicine that is well within the reach of most students.

      <p class="light team_font_size mobile_margin">
      The group aims to work toward the betterment of education and healthcare sectors especially in the rural areas. It is already providing scholarships to the needy and has adopted schools. The Foundation constantly endeavors to contribute as meaningfully as possible towards social development and enrichment of the society. The hospital will have a hierarchy of objectives, viz. Service, Training and Research. The most important objective for which the hospital will make all out effort will be to provide high quality service at an affordable cost not only for the affluent sections of the society, but also to those who may not be economically well off. The outpatient services will be provided on the concept of polyclinics and referral clinics.

      Pushpam Foundation aims to develop, establish & operate Pushpam School Of Medicine to cater to medical education, research and development near Chikabalapur, Karnataka on a 21 acre land. The project will include a state of the art hospital which will be a pioneer not just in the vicinity but in the entire country to bring the latest in the fields of medical technology and medical delivery at affordable costs and scale. Being well established promotors & developers, Pushpam Group will bring all its expertise & managerial knowledge in the field to design & develop buildings that meet global standards for aesthetics, appeasement and operational efficiency. The hospital will have 450 beds, including plenty of rooms to accommodate overnight stays for families. The various amenities installed in the rooms will not only increase the comfort of the patients but will help improve the outcome of the treatments. Large screens and computer broadcasting systems across the buildings will provide students & researchers with real-time tracking and learning opportunities. As for the physicians, nurses and researchers, the new facility offers several spacious operating rooms able to accommodate patients with the most complex medical conditions requiring multidisciplinary teams. Keeping in mind the future and growing concerns by the decade, Puspham will focus on making this project as eco-friendly and self-sustainable as possible. Further, the entire structure will be based on a grid system organized into modular cubes that repeat in a pattern. These cubes can be repurposed over time to accommodate the facility's changing needs in the future. For example, one cube can be switched between patient rooms and operating rooms without affection the basic framework of the building. An often overlooked yet significant key to success in such a venture is the people. Hence, we are motivated & heavily invested in recruiting professionals & teams of highest quality, skills, experience and dedication. This will ensure the Foundation will always strive to achieve optimal outcomes. Hence, the development's features clubbed with the new age amenities of the educational institute & hospital, will propel Pushpam School of Medicine to a world class institution, acting as a stepping stone for Medicine in India to set new standards for the rest of the world.TRYBT
